# Password-Protected-Website
This code represents a simple project that demonstrates a protected website with a passcode entry. It showcases both frontend and backend components: the frontend includes an HTML form for entering a passcode, and the backend consists of a Python HTTP server that handles the passcode validation and serves the website content.
